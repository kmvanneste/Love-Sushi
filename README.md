## About <a name="about"></a>

Keep track of you sushi consumption by typing in the name of a sushi dish, then placing it either in the "planning to eat" or "eaten" category.

The front-end of this project is simple and silly.  However, the back-end is more complex. As a developer I got to practice writing routes, develop an ORM, and connect to a MySQL database.
